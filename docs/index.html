About
I'm curious about connections we can draw between urban and rural 
ecosystems. 
I strive to link people with their local landscapes through exciting 
environmental lesson plans and data-informed managment decisions. I'm intensely 
curious about how nature-based solutions increase an ecological conscience in 
populated places, including the use of wild crop relatives and native seed 
growout and exchange. With my macroinvertebrate diversity studies and  botanical
toring around low tech restoration beaver dam analogs, I hope to support
grassroots restoration efforts with data.

Title: "Projects"
In the fall of 2024, I led groups of students to Robert's Ranch in Livermore
Colorado, where we used forensic botany to assess wetland plant occurrence.

-navegation to 4WD roads on Robert's Ranch
-map creation with ArcGIS Pro and Avenza
-I consulted the NRCS web soil survey to compare soil conditions with wetland 
establishment success
-synthesis of past monitoring analyses, which had varying focuses, to clarify
monitoring objectives for future groups


In 2024, I also consulted with local land managers about ecosystem management
in a semi-urban habitat, North Shields Ponds, creating an integrated weed
management plan based on their priorities and exploring mechanical, chemical,
and cultural weed management options to improve wildlife habitat.

-Using ArcGIS FieldMaps to create weed management zone polygons
-map creation in ArcGIS pro
-phone interviews with local land managers
-analyzing species occurrence for wildlife habitat to prioritize weed managment zones


In 2023, I conducted an independent study assessing macroinvertebrate diversity
beneath cacao trees in eastern Ecuador, where the region's agroforestry provides
a shining example of urban ecological integration.
